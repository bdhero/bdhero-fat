Chores
======

[ ] Add logging
    [ ] ProcessUtils and DotNetUtils?
[ ] Unit tests
    [ ] Exception handling in all scenarios

Bugs
====

[ ] Parse FFmpeg error output when output path is not writeable (dir doesn't exist)
[ ] Estimated time left -- double decrement bug

Features
========

[ ] Angle support
[ ] Fix or remove "low quality" playlist detection
[ ] Consider chapter count and timestamps when looking for duplicate playlists (playlists w/ identical streams but different chapters are not dups)

[ ] CLI prompt to select TMDb search result, playlist, angle, overwrite existing file
[ ] Plugin hooks for UI events:
    [ ] Select a movie/TV show
    [ ] Re-configure playlist (change Cut, Language, selected tracks) -- (for updating output file name, MKV title, track title)
[ ] File Namer placeholders
    [ ] Add fields to Job class for DirectoryPathTemplate and FileNameTemplate, which File Namer will combine and expand into OutputMkvPath
[ ] Allow any BD-ROM file/subdirectory to be scanned

Backlog
=======

[ ] Allow pausing of tasks

[ ] CLI arg to dump list of main movie playlist files
[ ] Separate file namer preferences for movies and TV shows
[ ] Asynchronous TMDb poster/cover art getter thread (use futures?)

[ ] Move output file name settings out into Preferences dialog (similar to mmg)

Chris' Plugins
==============

[ ] URI encoding (e.g., http://chapterdb.org/chapters/search?title=BLACK HAWK DOWN&chapterCount=0)
[ ] Search ALL media types in Chapter Grabber plugin (not just Blu-ray)
[ ] Use chapter grabber plugin to auto-detect main movie by comparing playlists to ChapterDb search results

[X] Create parent dirs of output file
[X] What if mkvpropedit.exe, ffmpeg.exe, etc. don't exist?  Currently the UI just hangs

[X] Exception when pressing cancel during FFmpeg after EXE has exited immediately due to an error:
System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: No process is associated with this object.
   at System.Diagnostics.Process.get_HasExited()
   at ProcessUtils.NonInteractiveProcess.get_CanKill()
[X] mkvpropedit.exe
[X] Filter bad chars in output file names
[X] Fix race condition in cancelation/status reporting
[X] Allow cancellation of tasks
[X] Dependency Injection
[X] Threaded controller
    http://reedcopsey.com/2009/11/17/synchronizing-net-4-tasks-with-the-ui-thread/
[X] Break Controller.cs into separate classes: AppConfig (initialize directories; singleton), LogInitializer (singleton), PluginLoader
[X] Reorganize solution using VS "Solution Folders"
[X] Basic CLI args
