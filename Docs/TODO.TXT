[ ] NPE when scanning CASINO_ROYAL:
    2013-07-01 00:59:14,967 [1176][1] ERROR BDHero.Controller - Unhandled exception was thrown by plugin

[ ] Exception thrown in FileUtils.CreateDirectory() when user types in goofy output path
[ ] Time Remaining is jumpy, esp. > 80% complete.  Thread queue?
[ ] GUI repaints but does not respond to user input while scanning disc.  Thread queue?

Features
========

[ ] Drag-n-drop scanning
[ ] Scan automatically after Browse

[ ] Update output MKV path when user's selection changes
[ ] Switch to "Save File" dialog for output MKV path
[ ] Split output MKV path into directory and file name
[ ] File Namer placeholders
    [ ] Add fields to Job class for DirectoryPathTemplate and FileNameTemplate, which File Namer will combine and expand into OutputMkvPath

[ ] Angle support
[ ] Fix or remove "low quality" playlist detection
[ ] Consider chapter count and timestamps when looking for duplicate playlists (playlists w/ identical streams but different chapters are not dups)

[ ] CLI prompt to select TMDb search result, playlist, angle, overwrite existing file
[ ] Plugin hooks for UI events:
    [ ] Select a movie/TV show
    [ ] Re-configure playlist (change Cut, Language, selected tracks) -- (for updating output file name, MKV title, track title)
[ ] Allow any BD-ROM file/subdirectory to be scanned

Backlog
=======

[ ] Allow pausing of tasks

[ ] CLI arg to dump list of main movie playlist files
[ ] Separate file namer preferences for movies and TV shows
[ ] Asynchronous TMDb poster/cover art getter thread (use futures?)

[ ] Move output file name settings out into Preferences dialog (similar to mmg)

[ ] Add Windows 7 Taskbar buttons for pause/resume and cancel
[ ] Add Windows 7 Taskbar jump lists?

Chris' Plugins
==============

[ ] Chapter Grabber: (THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS):
    01:57:31.210: Freedom and Sunlight
    02:00:12.371: End Credits
    02:09:13.745: 
[ ] Chapter Grabber: (IN_TIME)
    Scene 1
    Scene 2
    Scene 3
[ ] URI encoding (e.g., http://chapterdb.org/chapters/search?title=BLACK HAWK DOWN&chapterCount=0)
[ ] Search ALL media types in Chapter Grabber plugin (not just Blu-ray)
[ ] Use chapter grabber plugin to auto-detect main movie by comparing playlists to ChapterDb search results

[X] Don't skip unknown codecs - ffmpeg includes ALL codecs when counting streams (even IGS and DTS Express), which means BDHero's track indexes won't match
[X] Estimated time left -- double decrement bug
[X] Exception not propagated to UI and doesn't stop UI:

[X] Reorganize solution using VS "Solution Folders"
[X] Basic CLI args
[X] Remove PluginException
[X] Auto file namer
[X] Error detection, handling, and status for FFmpeg (stderr + exit code)
[X] Job objects not working
[X] Movie title (year) in MKV title field
[X] Use larger poster image

[N] Don't set PGS subs to default
[!] Auto-default tracks in FFmpeg/MkvPropEdit (doesn't appear to be possible: FFmpeg doesn't include the flags in its output, so adding them with mkvpropedit breaks the MKV file)
