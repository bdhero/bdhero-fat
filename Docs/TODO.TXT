Bugs
====

[ ] Estimated time left -- double decrement bug

[ ] Plugin hooks for UI events:
    [ ] Select a movie/TV show
    [ ] Re-configure playlist (change Cut, Language, selected tracks) -- (for updating output file name, MKV title, track title)
[ ] File Namer placeholders
    [ ] Add fields to Job class for DirectoryPathTemplate and FileNameTemplate, which File Namer will combine and expand into OutputMkvPath
[ ] Allow any BD-ROM file/subdirectory to be scanned

Backlog
=======

[ ] Allow pausing of tasks

[ ] CLI arg to dump list of main movie playlist files
[ ] Separate file namer preferences for movies and TV shows
[ ] Asynchronous TMDb poster/cover art getter thread (use futures?)

[ ] Move output file name settings out into Preferences dialog (similar to mmg)

[ ] Add Windows 7 Taskbar buttons for pause/resume and cancel
[ ] Add Windows 7 Taskbar jump lists?

Chris' Plugins
==============

[ ] URI encoding (e.g., http://chapterdb.org/chapters/search?title=BLACK HAWK DOWN&chapterCount=0)
[ ] Search ALL media types in Chapter Grabber plugin (not just Blu-ray)
[ ] Use chapter grabber plugin to auto-detect main movie by comparing playlists to ChapterDb search results

[X] Reorganize solution using VS "Solution Folders"
[X] Basic CLI args

[X] Auto file namer
[X] Error detection, handling, and status for FFmpeg (stderr + exit code)

[N] Don't set PGS subs to default
[!] Auto-default tracks in FFmpeg/MkvPropEdit (doesn't appear to be possible: FFmpeg doesn't include the flags in its output, so adding them with mkvpropedit breaks the MKV file)
